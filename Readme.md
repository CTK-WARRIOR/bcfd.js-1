# About

My idea was to simply create the package which will let the bot commander for discord user import their commands into JS for which they will have to provide JSON data which can be get from the app as it store its database in JSON.

I was very excited at the start but after some time i decided to abondon the project as it was going to be quite big thing i was out of time. i was able to create the base of package.

So, in the end if anyone want to continue this project than he can do that, you can take idea how i did some stuff.
